# Homework #1

## Instructions
---
1. Feynman Writing Prompts - Write out explanations of the following concepts like you are explaining it to a 12 year old.  Doing this will help you quickly discover any holes in your understanding.  Ask your questions on Slack.
		
	* Functions
  Functions are blocks of code.  These blocks of code are like little machines you program to do chores like math or double-checking the answers you gave on your homework, or waking you up in time for school.
  
	* Parameters
  Parameters are things you can define in your function to make it easier to write, and more adaptable.  For example, if you tell your function, "Take X and Y, add them together and give the result back to me," you could have it do math or make compound words!
  
	* Arguments
  Arguments are things you give your function to use.  You can define your function to use as many arguments as you want, and they don't all have to be the same type of thing.  In fact, you can give your function 3 different arguments and have it do something different with each of them!
  
	* `if` statements
  `if` statements give your function some brains.  For example, you can make your function sort your clothes for you by telling it, "if x is a t-shirt, put it in the t-shirt drawer, else if x is a sock, put it in the sock drawer, else if x is shorts or a pair of jeans, put it in the bottoms drawer," and so on.  Another great thing is, you can use `if` statements to only accept arguments if you want them.  For instance, if you only want to eat pizza for dinner, you can tell your function, "if x is equal to pizza give it to me," and it will ignore/throw away everything that's not pizza!

2. Install Node and NPM.  NPM comes packaged with Node. https://nodejs.org/en/download/


3. Download (clone) this project folder from GitHub.


4. Navigate into the downloaded folder using Terminal(Mac) or Command Prompt(Windows).  `ls`(Mac), `dir`(Windows) and `cd <directory_name>` are the commands you need to navigate around.


5. Once you are in the folder type the command `npm install`.  This will fetch all of the needed requirements for the project.


6. Run `npm test` to run the automated tests.  At first all of the tests will be broken.  You will fill out the functions in `exercises.js` to make the tests pass.
